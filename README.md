# java
a repo for GIS and Computer science Student at EHTP, which contains most of java class exercises and exams that were given.

just a friendly reminder: my code may not be clean as I think it's. it's up to you to do whatever you want with it. 

most of my classmates used Eclipse. but I prefer VS code. So in case it doesnt work just copy paste the code in Vs and open the terminal in your folder. then run the following command and it will work: java fileName.java
